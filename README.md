3. Place the SuperMetroid ROM, the .IPS patch and Lunar IPS.exe into the same folder
4. Double click on Lunar IPS.exe, click "Apply Patch".
5. Select the .IPS file.
6. Next it will have you select a ROM file to apply the patch to.
7. Download an SNES emulator.
8. Find your emulator after installing, and double click it (the .exe file).
9. Go under "File", then "Open ROM", and look for the ROM. If you applied it correctly, the game should load.

*Alternate control scheme (GBA)*
- hold R (aim up) to aim lock up or down with dpad
- hold L (aim down) to select missile (or power bomb when morphed)
- press Y (item cancel) to fire grapple beam
- hold B (dash) to make Samus walk (run by default)
- aiming straight up while crouched is disabled
- auto-item cancel is disabled
